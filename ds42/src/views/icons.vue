                            <p>Our icons are the visual identifiers of Alliedâ€™s digital experiences, including our services and tools. Icons communicate the core idea and intent of a product in a simple, bold, and friendly way. While each icon is visually distinct, all product icons for our brand should be unified through concept and execution.</p>
                            <p>These guidelines are a starting point to ensure that your product icon colors and key elements reflect our brand identity.</p>
